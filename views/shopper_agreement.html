    <h2 id="head">Halanx shopper's terms</h2>
    <p class="new">This Agreement ("Agreement") is made and entered into by and between you, the undersigned contractor ("CONTRACTOR"), an independent contractor engaged in the business of performing the delivery services contemplated by this Agreement, and HALANX TECHNOLOGIES PRIVATE LIMITED ("HALANX" or "COMPANY"). This Agreement will become effective on the date it is accepted regardless of whether you are eligible to, or ever do, perform any Contracted Services.</p>
<p class="new">IMPORTANT: PLEASE REVIEW THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY. IN PARTICULAR, PLEASE REVIEW THE MUTUAL ARBITRATION PROVISION IN SECTION XI, AS IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES (UNLESS YOU OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION AS PROVIDED BELOW) TO RESOLVE DISPUTES ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION. BY ACCEPTING THIS AGREEMENT, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD ALL OF THE TERMS, INCLUDING SECTION XI, AND HAVE TAKEN THE TIME AND SOUGHT ANY ASSISTANCE NEEDED TO COMPREHEND THE CONSEQUENCES OF ACCEPTING THIS AGREEMENT.</p>
<!--<p class="new">You also acknowledge and agree that, except as expressly provided for otherwise in these Terms or a separate agreement between you and Halanx, Halanx does not form any employment or agency relationship with you and does not hold title to any goods that you order through the Services.<p>-->
<div class="head-content">THE PARTIES</div>
<p class="new">HALANX is a company that provides an online marketplace connection using web-based technology that connects contractors, stores and/or other businesses, and consumers ("HALANX platform" or "platform"). HALANX's software permits registered users to place orders for food and/or other goods from various stores and businesses. Once such orders are made, HALANX software notifies contractors that a delivery opportunity is available and the HALANX software facilitates completion of the delivery. HALANX is not a store, food delivery service, or food preparation business.</p>
<p class="new">CONTRACTOR is an independent provider of delivery services, authorized to conduct the delivery services contemplated by this Agreement in the geographic location(s) in which CONTRACTOR operates. CONTRACTOR possesses all equipment and personnel necessary to perform the delivery services contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with applicable laws. CONTRACTOR desires to enter into this Agreement for the right to receive delivery opportunities made available through HALANX'S platform.</p>
<p class="new">CONTRACTOR understands and expressly agrees that he/she is not an employee of HALANX or any store, other business or consumer and that he/she is providing delivery services on behalf of him/herself and his/her business, not on behalf of HALANX. CONTRACTOR understands (i) he/she is free to select those times he/she wishes to be available on the platform to receive delivery opportunities; (ii) he/she is free to accept or reject the opportunities transmitted through the HALANX platform by consumers, and can make such decisions to maximize his/her opportunity to profit; and (iii) he/she has the sole right to control the manner in which deliveries are performed and the means by which those deliveries are completed.</p>
<p class="new">In consideration of the above, as well as the mutual promises described herein, HALANX and CONTRACTOR (collectively "the parties") agree as follows:</p>

<div class="head-content">I. PURPOSE OF THE AGREEMENT</div>
<ol>
    <li class="new">This Agreement governs the relationship between HALANX and CONTRACTOR, and establishes the parties' respective rights and obligations. In exchange for the promises contained in this Agreement, CONTRACTOR shall have the right and obligation to perform the "Contracted Services" as defined herein. However, nothing in this Agreement requires CONTRACTOR to perform any particular volume of Contracted Services during the term of this Agreement, and nothing in this Agreement shall guarantee CONTRACTOR any particular volume of business for any particular time period.</li>
    <li class="new">CONTRACTOR shall have no obligation to accept or perform any particular "Delivery Opportunity" (as that term is defined herein) offered by HALANX. However, once a Delivery Opportunity is accepted, CONTRACTOR shall be contractually bound to complete the Contracted Services in accordance with all consumer specifications and the terms laid out in this Agreement.</li>
</ol>
<div class="head-content">II. CONTRACTOR'S OPERATIONS</div>
<ol>
    <li class="new">CONTRACTOR represents that he/she operates an independently established enterprise that provides delivery services, and that he/she satisfies all legal requirements necessary to perform the services contemplated by this Agreement. As an independent contractor/enterprise, CONTRACTOR shall be solely responsible for determining how to operate his/her business and how to perform the Contracted Services.</li>
    <li class="new">CONTRACTOR agrees to fully perform the Contracted Services in a timely, efficient, safe, and lawful manner. HALANX shall have no right to, and shall not, control the manner, method or means CONTRACTOR uses to perform the Contracted Services. Instead, CONTRACTOR shall be solely responsible for determining the most effective, efficient, and safe manner to perform the Contracted Services, including determining the manner of pickup, delivery, and route selection.</li>
    <li class="new">As an independent business enterprise, CONTRACTOR retains the right to perform services (whether delivery services or other services) for others and to hold him/herself out to the general public as a separately established business. The parties recognize that they are or may be engaged in similar arrangements with others and nothing in this Agreement shall prevent CONTRACTOR or HALANX from doing business with others. HALANX does not have the right to restrict CONTRACTOR from performing services for other businesses, customers or consumers at any time, even if such business directly competes with HALANX, and even during the time CONTRACTOR is logged into the HALANX platform.</li>
    <li class="new">CONTRACTOR is not required to purchase, lease, or rent any products, equipment or services from HALANX as a condition of doing business with HALANX or entering into this Agreement.</li>
    <li class="new">CONTRACTOR agrees to immediately notify HALANX in writing at support@halanx.com if CONTRACTOR's right to control the manner or method he/she uses to perform services differs from the terms contemplated in this Section.</li>
</ol>
<div class="head-content">III. CONTRACTED SERVICES</div>
<ol>
    <li class="new">From time to time, the HALANX platform will notify CONTRACTOR of the opportunity to complete deliveries from stores or other businesses to consumers in accordance with orders placed by consumers through the HALANX platform (each of these is referred to as a "Delivery Opportunity"). For each Delivery Opportunity accepted by CONTRACTOR ("Contracted Service"), CONTRACTOR agrees to retrieve the orders from stores or other businesses, ensure the order was accurately filled, and deliver the order to consumers in a safe and timely fashion. CONTRACTOR understands and agrees that the parameters of each Contracted Service are established by the consumer, not HALANX, and represent the end result desired, not the means by which CONTRACTOR is to accomplish the result. CONTRACTOR has the right to cancel, from time to time, a Contracted Service when, in the exercise of CONTRACTOR's reasonable discretion and business judgment, it is appropriate to do so. Notwithstanding the foregoing, CONTRACTOR agrees to maintain both a customer rating and a completion rateÂ as of the date this Agreement becomes effective. Failure to satisfy this obligation constitutes a material breach of this Agreement, and HALANX shall have the right to terminate this Agreement and/or deactivate CONTRACTOR'S account.</li>
    <li class="new">CONTRACTOR acknowledges that HALANX has discretion as to which, if any, Delivery Opportunity to offer, just as CONTRACTOR has the discretion whether and to what extent to accept any Delivery Opportunity.</li>
    <li class="new">CONTRACTOR authorizes HALANX, during the course of a Contracted Service, to communicate with CONTRACTOR, consumer, and/or store or other business to assist CONTRACTOR, to the extent permitted by CONTRACTOR, in facilitating deliveries. However, under no circumstances shall HALANX be authorized to control the manner or means by which CONTRACTOR performs delivery services.</li>
    <li class="new">CONTRACTOR may use whatever payment method he/she chooses to purchase items to be delivered to consumers, including, but not limited to CONTRACTOR's personal credit or debit card, cash or a prepaid card. CONTRACTOR may use, for CONTRACTOR's convenience, the prepaid card solely for purchasing items to be delivered to consumers. If CONTRACTOR chooses to use his/her personal credit or debit card or cash, CONTRACTOR shall invoice HALANX on a weekly basis and HALANX agrees to pay all invoices within 10 days of receipt.</li>
    <li class="new">In the event CONTRACTOR fails to fully perform any Contracted Service (a "Service Failure") due to CONTRACTOR's action or omission, CONTRACTOR shall forfeit all or part of the agreed upon fee for that service. If CONTRACTOR disputes responsibility for a Service Failure, the dispute shall be resolved pursuant to the "Payment Disputes" provision below.</li>
    <li class="new">CONTRACTOR agrees to immediately notify HALANX in writing at support@halanx.com if CONTRACTOR's services or scope of work differ in any way from what is contemplated in this Section.</li>
</ol>
<div class="head-content">IV. RELATIONSHIP OF PARTIES</div>
<ol>
    <li class="new">The parties acknowledge and agree that this Agreement is between two co-equal, independent business enterprises that are separately owned and operated. The parties intend this Agreement to create the relationship of principal and independent contractor and not that of employer and employee. The parties are not employees, agents, joint venturers, or partners of each other for any purpose. Neither party shall have the right to bind the other by contract or otherwise except as specifically provided in this Agreement.</li>
    <li class="new">HALANX shall not have the right to, and shall not, control the manner or the method of accomplishing Contracted Services to be performed by CONTRACTOR. The parties acknowledge and agree that those provisions of the Agreement reserving ultimate authority in HALANX have been inserted solely for the safety of consumers and other CONTRACTORS using the HALANX platform or to achieve compliance with federal, state, or local laws, regulations, and interpretations thereof.</li>
    <li class="new">HALANX shall report all payments made to CONTRACTOR on a calendar year basis, if the volume of payments to CONTRACTOR qualify. CONTRACTOR agrees to report all such payments and any cash gratuities to the appropriate federal, state and local taxing authorities.</li>
</ol>
<div class="head-content">V. PAYMENT FOR SERVICES</div>
<ol>
    <li class="new">Unless notified otherwise by HALANX in writing or except as provided herein, CONTRACTOR will receive payment per accurate Contracted Service completed in the amount listed in the payment schedule for the relevant market. From time to time, HALANX may offer opportunities for CONTRACTOR to earn more money for performing Contracted Services at specified times or in specified locations. Nothing prevents the parties from negotiating a different rate of pay, and CONTRACTOR is free to accept or deny any such opportunities to earn different rates of pay.</li>
    <li class="new">HALANX will process payments made by consumers and transmit to CONTRACTOR via direct deposit on a weekly basis unless it notifies CONTRACTOR otherwise in writing.</li>
    <li class="new">Notwithstanding the terms of Section V(1) â (3), fulfillment orders placed directly with merchants rather than through the App or halanx.com ("Fulfillment Orders") may be subject to a different payment model. Nothing prevents the parties from negotiating a different rate of pay for a Fulfillment Order, and the CONTRACTOR is free to accept or reject Fulfillment Order opportunities.</li>
    <li class="new">From time to time, HALANX may offer various Dasher promotions or referral programs. CONTRACTOR agrees that he or she will not manipulate or abuse the referral programs or Dasher promotions by, among other things: (a) tampering with the location feature on his or her mobile phone; (b) collecting incentive or promotional pay when not eligible to receive such pay under relevant policies; or, (c) creating multiple Dasher or consumer accounts. CONTRACTOR understands that engaging in this type of manipulation or abuse constitutes a material breach of this Agreement and may lead to deactivation of his or her account.</li>
</ol>
<div class="head-content">VI. PAYMENT DISPUTES</div>
<ol>
    <li class="new">CONTRACTOR's Failure: In the event there is a Service Failure, CONTRACTOR shall not be entitled to payment as described above (as determined in HALANX's reasonable discretion). Any withholding of payment shall be based upon proof provided by the consumer, store or other business, CONTRACTOR, and any other party with information relevant to the dispute. HALANX shall make the initial determination as to whether a Service Failure was the result of CONTRACTOR's action/omission. CONTRACTOR shall have the right to challenge HALANX's determination through any legal means contemplated by this Agreement; however, CONTRACTOR shall notify HALANX in writing at support@halanx.com of the challenge and provide HALANX the opportunity to resolve the dispute. CONTRACTOR should include any documents or other information in support of his/her challenge.</li>
    <li class="new">HALANX's Failure: In the event HALANX fails to remit payment in a timely or accurate manner, CONTRACTOR shall have the right to seek proper payment by any legal means contemplated by this Agreement and, should CONTRACTOR prevail, shall be entitled to recover reasonable costs incurred in pursuing proper payment, provided, however, CONTRACTOR shall first inform HALANX in writing at support@halanx.com of the failure and provide a reasonable opportunity to cure it.</li>
</ol>
<div class="head-content">VII. EQUIPMENT AND EXPENSES</div>
<ol>
    <li class="new">CONTRACTOR represents that he/she has or can lawfully acquire all equipment, including vehicles and food hot bags ("Equipment") necessary for performing contracted services, and CONTRACTOR is solely responsible for ensuring that the vehicle used conforms to all vehicle laws pertaining to safety, equipment, inspection, and operational capability.</li>
    <li class="new">CONTRACTOR agrees that he/she is responsible for all costs and expenses arising from CONTRACTOR's performance of Contracted Services, including, but not limited to, costs related to CONTRACTOR's Personnel (defined below) and Equipment. Except as otherwise required by law, CONTRACTOR assumes all risk of damage or loss to its Equipment.</li>
</ol>
<div class="head-content">VIII. PERSONNEL</div>
<ol>
    <li class="new">In order to perform any Contracted Services, CONTRACTOR must, for the safety of consumers on the HALANX platform, pass a background check administered by a third-party vendor or HALANX, subject to CONTRACTOR's lawful consent. CONTRACTOR is not required to perform any Contracted Services personally, but may, to the extent permitted by law and subject to the terms of this Agreement, hire or engage others (as employees or subcontractors of CONTRACTOR) to perform all or some of the Contracted Services, provided any such employees or subcontractors meet all the requirements applicable to CONTRACTOR including, but not limited to, the background check requirements that CONTRACTOR must meet in order to perform Contracted Services. To the extent CONTRACTOR furnishes his/her own employees or subcontractors (collectively "Personnel"), CONTRACTOR shall be solely responsible for the direction and control of the Personnel it uses to perform all Contracted Services.</li>
    <li class="new">CONTRACTOR assumes full and sole responsibility for the payment of all amounts due to his/her Personnel for work performed in relation to this Agreement, including all wages, benefits and expenses, if any, and for all required state and income tax withholdings, unemployment insurance contributions, and social security taxes as to CONTRACTOR and all Personnel employed by CONTRACTOR in the performance of Contracted Services under this Agreement. HALANX shall have no responsibility for any wages, benefits, expenses, or other payments due CONTRACTOR's Personnel, nor for income tax withholding, social security, unemployment insurance contributions, or other payroll taxes relating to CONTRACTOR or his/her Personnel. Neither CONTRACTOR nor his/her Personnel shall receive any wages, including vacation pay or holiday pay, from HALANX, nor shall they participate in or receive any other benefits, if any, available to HALANX's employees.</li>
    <li class="new">Unless mandated by law, HALANX shall have no authority to withhold state or federal income taxes, social security taxes, unemployment insurance taxes/contributions, or any other local, state or federal tax on behalf of CONTRACTOR or his/her Personnel.</li>
    <li class="new">CONTRACTOR and his/her Personnel shall not be required to wear a uniform or other clothing of any type bearing HALANX's name or logo.</li>
    <li class="new">If CONTRACTOR uses the services of any Personnel to perform the Contracted Services, CONTRACTOR's Personnel must satisfy and comply with all of the terms of this Agreement, which CONTRACTOR must make enforceable by written agreement between CONTRACTOR and such Personnel. A copy of such written agreement must be provided to HALANX at least 7 days in advance of such Personnel performing the Contracted Services. The parties acknowledge that the sole purpose of this requirement is to ensure CONTRACTOR's compliance with the terms of this Agreement.</li>
</ol>
<div class="head-content">IX. INSURANCE</div>
<ol>
    <li class="new">CONTRACTOR agrees, as a condition of doing business with HALANX, that during the term of this Agreement, CONTRACTOR will maintain current insurance, in amounts and of types required by law to provide the Contracted Services, at his/her own expense. CONTRACTOR acknowledges that failure to secure or maintain satisfactory insurance coverage shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement and shall result in the termination of the Agreement and the loss of CONTRACTOR's right to receive Delivery Opportunities.</li>
    <li class="new"><strong>NOTIFICATION OF COVERAGE:</strong> CONTRACTOR agrees to deliver to HALANX, upon request, current certificates of insurance as proof of coverage. CONTRACTOR agrees to provide updated certificates each time CONTRACTOR purchases, renews, or alters CONTRACTOR's insurance coverage. CONTRACTOR agrees to give HALANX at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice before cancellation of any insurance policy required by this Agreement.</li>
    <li class="new"><strong>WORKERS' COMPENSATION/OCCUPATIONAL ACCIDENT INSURANCE:</strong>Â CONTRACTOR agrees that CONTRACTOR will not be eligible for workers' compensation benefits through HALANX, and instead, will be responsible for providing CONTRACTOR's own workers' compensation insurance or occupational accident insurance, if permitted by law.</li>
</ol>
<div class="head-content">X. INDEMNITY</div>
<ol>
    <li class="new">HALANX agrees to indemnify, protect and hold harmless CONTRACTOR from any and all claims, demands, damages, suits, losses, liabilities and causes of action arising directly from HALANX's actions arranging and offering the Contracted Services to CONTRACTOR.</li>
    <li class="new">CONTRACTOR agrees to indemnify, protect and hold harmless HALANX, including all parent, subsidiary and/or affiliated companies, as well as its and their past and present successors, assigns, officers, owners, directors, agents, representatives, attorneys, and employees, from any and all claims, demands, damages, suits, losses, liabilities and causes of action arising directly or indirectly from, as a result of or in connection with, the actions of CONTRACTOR and/or his/her Personnel arising from the performance of delivery services under this Agreement, including personal injury or death to any person (including to CONTRACTOR and/or his/her Personnel), as well as any liability arising from CONTRACTOR's failure to comply with the terms of this Agreement. CONTRACTOR's obligations hereunder shall include the cost of defense, including attorneys' fees, as well as the payment of any final judgment rendered against or settlement agreed upon by HALANX or its parent, subsidiary and/or affiliated companies.</li>
    <li class="new">CONTRACTOR agrees to indemnify, protect and hold harmless HALANX, including all parent, subsidiary, and/or affiliated companies, as well as its and their past and present successors, assigns, officers, owners, directors, agents, representatives, attorneys, and employees, from any and all tax liabilities and responsibilities for payment of all federal, state and local taxes, including, but not limited to all payroll taxes, self-employment taxes, workers compensation premiums, and any contributions imposed or required under federal, state and local laws, with respect to CONTRACTOR and CONTRACTOR's Personnel.</li>
    <li class="new">CONTRACTOR shall be responsible for, indemnify and hold harmless HALANX, including all parent, subsidiary, and/or affiliated companies, as well as its and their past and present successors, assigns, officers, owners, directors, agents, representatives, attorneys, and employees, from all costs of CONTRACTOR's business, including, but not limited to, the expense and responsibility for any and all applicable insurance, local, state or federal licenses, permits, taxes, and assessments of any and all regulatory agencies, boards or municipalities.</li>
</ol>
<div class="head-content">XI. MUTUAL ARBITRATION PROVISION</div>
<ol>
    <li class="new">CONTRACTOR and HALANX mutually agree to resolve any justiciable disputes between them exclusively through final and binding arbitration instead of filing a lawsuit in court.</li>
    <li class="new">If either CONTRACTOR or HALANX wishes to initiate arbitration, the initiating party must notify the other party in writing via certified mail, return receipt requested, or hand delivery within the applicable statute of limitations period. This demand for arbitration must include (1) the name and address of the party seeking arbitration, (2) a statement of the legal and factual basis of the claim, and (3) a description of the remedy sought.</li>
    <li class="new">Class Action Waiver. CONTRACTOR and HALANX mutually agree that by entering into this agreement to arbitrate, both waive their right to have any dispute or claim brought, heard or arbitrated as, or to participate in, a class action, collective action and/or representative action, and an arbitrator shall not have any authority to hear or arbitrate any class, collective or representative action ("Class Action Waiver"). Notwithstanding any other clause contained in this Agreement or the AAA Rules, as defined below, any claim that all or part of this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. In any case in which (1) the dispute is filed as a class, collective, or representative action and (2) there is a final judicial determination that all or part of the Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, the class, collective and/or representative action to that extent must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction, but the portion of the Class Action Waiver that is enforceable shall be enforced in arbitration. Notwithstanding any other clause contained in this Agreement or the AAA Rules, as defined below, any claim that all or part of this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. All other disputes with respect to whether this Mutual Arbitration Provision is unenforceable, unconscionable, applicable, valid, void or voidable shall be determined exclusively by an arbitrator, and not by any court.</li> 
    <li class="new">CONTRACTOR agrees and acknowledges that entering into this arbitration agreement does not change CONTRACTOR's status as an independent contractor in fact and in law, that CONTRACTOR is not an employee of HALANX or its customers and that any disputes in this regard shall be subject to arbitration as provided in this agreement.</li>   
</ol>
<div class="head-content">XII. TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT</div>
<ol>
    <li class="new">CONTRACTOR may terminate this Agreement upon seven (7) days written notice. HALANX may terminate this Agreement and deactivate CONTRACTORâS shopper account for any reason in deactivation policy, or for a material breach of this Agreement.Â Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, HALANX reserves the right to modify the Deactivation Policy if, in HALANXâs good faith and reasonable discretion, it is necessary to do so for the safe and/or effective operation of the HALANX platform. HALANX shall provide notice of any such changes to CONTRACTOR via e-mail. Changes to the Deactivation Policy shall be effective and binding on the parties upon CONTRACTORâs continued use of the HALANX platform following HALANXâs e-mail notice of such modifications. Nothing will prevent CONTRACTOR from attempting to negotiate an exemption from any modification to the Deactivation Policy.</li>
    <li class="new">CONTRACTOR's and HALANX's obligations and rights arising under the Mutual Arbitration Provision of this Agreement shall survive termination of this Agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, the Deactivation Policy is subject to change; such changes shall be effective and binding on the parties upon HALANXâS provision of notice to CONTRACTOR via e-mail.</li>   
</ol>
<div class="head-content">XIII. ENTIRE AGREEMENT, TRANSFERABILITY, AND WAIVER</div>
<ol>
    <li class="new">This Agreement shall constitute the entire agreement and understanding between the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and shall not be modified, altered, changed or amended in any respect, unless in writing and signed by both parties. Before accepting any modifications, alterations, changes or amendments, CONTRACTOR shall have the right to discuss any proposed changes with HALANX and consider whether to continue his/her contractual relationship with HALANX. This Agreement supersedes any prior contract between the parties. To the extent HALANX's consumer facing Terms and Conditions Agreement (or updated consumer facing Terms and Conditions Agreement, if applicable) is inconsistent or conflicts with this Agreement, this Agreement controls. However, the decision to opt-out of the Mutual Arbitration Provision in this Agreement does not affect the enforceability of any arbitration agreement in the consumer facing Terms and Conditions Agreement to which Contractor may be bound (and vice versa). This Agreement may not be assigned by either party without written consent of the other and shall be binding upon the parties hereto, including their heirs and successors, provided, however, that HALANX may assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement to an affiliate of HALANX or any successor(s) to its business and/or purchaser of substantially all of its stock or assets. References in this Agreement to HALANX shall be deemed to include such successor(s).</li>  
    <li class="new">The failure of HALANX or CONTRACTOR in any instance to insist upon a strict performance of the terms of this Agreement or to exercise any option herein, shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment of such term or option and such term or option shall continue in full force and effect.</li>
