    <p class="new">BEFORE YOU PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM(S) OPERATED BY HALANX TECHNOLOGIES PRIVATE LIMITED (“HALANX”) THAT ARE COVERED BY THESE HALANX MERCHANT TERMS OF USE (“MERCHANT TERMS” OR “TERMS”), PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY. BY EXECUTING THE SIGN-UP SHEET WITH HALANX, YOU OR THE ENTITY THAT YOU REPRESENT AGREE ON BEHALF OF ALL PARTICIPATING STORE LOCATIONS TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS TO THE EXCLUSION OF ALL OTHER TERMS.</p>
<p class="new">SECTION 15 OF THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS PROVISIONS THAT GOVERN HOW CLAIMS THAT YOU AND WE HAVE AGAINST EACH OTHER ARE RESOLVED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY CLAIMS THAT AROSE OR WERE ASSERTED BEFORE THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS AGREEMENT. IN PARTICULAR, SECTION 15 SETS FORTH OUR ARBITRATION AGREEMENT WHICH WILL, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS, REQUIRE DISPUTES BETWEEN US TO BE SUBMITTED TO BINDING AND FINAL ARBITRATION. UNLESS YOU OPT OUT OF THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT: (1) YOU WILL ONLY BE PERMITTED TO PURSUE CLAIMS AND SEEK RELIEF AGAINST US ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING; AND (2) YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO SEEK RELIEF IN A COURT OF LAW AND TO HAVE A JURY TRIAL ON YOUR CLAIMS. THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT COULD AFFECT YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN PENDING PROPOSED CLASS ACTION LITIGATION. PLEASE SEE SECTION 16 FOR MORE INFORMATION REGARDING THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, THE POSSIBLE EFFECTS OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, AND HOW TO OPT OUT OF THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.</p>
<!--<p class="new">You also acknowledge and agree that, except as expressly provided for otherwise in these Terms or a separate agreement between you and Halanx, Halanx does not form any employment or agency relationship with you and does not hold title to any goods that you order through the Services.<p>-->

<div class="head-content">1. Halanx Core Responsibilities.</div>
<p class="new">Halanx will:</p>
<ol type="a">
    <li class="new">Display Merchant’s logo; a listing of the Merchant stores that are listed on the Sign-Up Sheet Appendix or later added by an exchange of emails and that are within any then-current territory serviced by Halanx (“Merchant Stores”); and a list of all products offered for delivery orders at Merchant Stores (“Merchant Products”);</li>
    <li class="new">Accept orders for Merchant Products through Halanx’s proprietary system (the “Halanx Marketplace” or the “Halanx Platform”) from Halanx customers (“Orders”);</li>
    <li class="new">Forward each Order to the relevant Merchant Store; and</li>
    <li class="new">Forward each Order to a third-party delivery contractor (“Shopper”), so that the Shopper can pick up the applicable Merchant Product(s) from the Merchant Store to deliver to the Halanx customer (“End Customer”). If Halanx determines, in its reasonable discretion, that continuing to support Orders of a particular Merchant Product or Merchant Store could subject Halanx to undue regulatory risk or other liability, then Halanx may remove such Merchant Product and/or Merchant Store from the Halanx Marketplace.</li>
</ol>

<div class="head-content">2. Merchant Core Responsibilities.</div>
<p class="new">Merchant will:</p>
<ol type="a">
    <li class="new">Provide Halanx with the Merchant’s in-store product list, including the price of each item on that list, and notify Halanx of any updates made to the Merchant’s in-store list within 3 business days from the date of change;</li>
    <li class="new">Accept all Orders placed by Halanx from Merchant’s then-current list;</li>
    <li class="new">Confirm all Orders from Halanx in a prompt and timely manner;</li>
    <li class="new">Prepare the Merchant Products for each Order for pickup by a Shopper at the designated time;</li>

    <li class="new">Promptly notify Halanx of any changes to the pricing, availability, description, or other characteristics of the Merchant Products;</li>
    <li class="new">Notify Halanx of its days and hours of operation, and remain open for business on Halanx the same days and hours of operation as Merchant’s in-store business; notify Halanx of any changes to Merchant’s hours of operations on federal holidays; and notify Halanx if Merchant closes earlier than Merchant’s standard hours of operation or plans to close earlier than Merchant’s standard hours of operation;</li>
    <li class="new">Notify all Merchant store staff members of the relationship with Halanx immediately upon execution of this Agreement; and</li>
    <li class="new">Provide the same utensils, napkins, bags and other materials that Merchant would typically provide in a standard take-out or delivery order.</li>
</ol>
<div class="head-content">3. Refunds and Re-Orders.</div>
 <p class="new">In the event that Halanx, in its sole discretion, has to issue a refund or re-order on an End Customer’s Order, Merchant will prepare the order to the same specifications as the original Order (in the case of a re-order) and bear the full cost of that refund or re-order, unless the refund or re-order is due to the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Shoppers or Halanx.</p>

<div class="head-content">4. Order Equipment.</div>
 <p class="new">Merchant will install any equipment reasonably required by Halanx for Merchant to receive Orders (including, without limitation, a tablet, fax machine, or other automated, electronic means of receiving Orders) (“Order Equipment”). Any Order Equipment provided by Halanx will remain Halanx’s sole property and may be used solely for purposes related to fulfilling Merchant’s responsibilities under this Agreement. Merchant agrees to use any security procedures or protocols or access credentials as requested by Halanx. Merchant will not allow any third party to use the Halanx Platform; copy, modify, rent, lease, sell, distribute, reverse engineer or otherwise attempt to gain access to the source code of the Halanx Platform; damage, destroy or impede the services provided through the Halanx Platform; transmit injurious code; or bypass or breach any security protection on the Halanx Platform. Halanx may restrict or rescind Merchant’s right to use the Halanx Platform at any time. Merchant will be responsible for any damage to or loss of any Order Equipment provided by Halanx, which will be promptly reimbursed by Merchant (at the replacement cost thereof). Halanx may recover the replacement cost of damaged or lost Order Equipment by deducting such amount from weekly payments.</p>

<div class="head-content">5. Payment, Fees, and Taxes.</div>
 <p class="new">Halanx will pay for Orders filled by Merchant each week on a consistent day of the week, currently Mondays, subject to change with no less than 10 days notice to merchants by email or service notification, provided that Halanx shall be entitled to deduct from such payment the Promotion Fee on all Orders. If Merchant has opted for a tablet subscription, Halanx will also deduct a weekly fee, as set forth on the Sign-Up Sheet. For the avoidance of doubt, Halanx will be entitled to a Promotion Fee on all Orders at the rate stated in the Sign-Up Sheet and Halanx may also elect (in its sole discretion) to charge an End Customer fees, including but not limited to a Delivery Fee and/or a Service Fee, as well as an additional markup for Merchant Products.

 <div class="head-content">15. Dispute Resolution.</div>
 <p class="new">PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY. IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH THE COMPANY AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF. THIS SECTION 15 OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE REFERRED TO AS THE “ARBITRATION AGREEMENT”.</p>
 <ol type="a">
     <li class="new"><strong>Scope of Arbitration Agreement.</strong> Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of, relating to or in connection with this contract, including the breach, termination or validity thereof, shall be finally resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that (1) you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify, so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis; and (2) you or the Company may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents). This Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all claims that arose or were asserted before the Effective Date of this Agreement. CASES HAVE BEEN FILED AGAINST THE COMPANY—AND OTHERS MAY BE FILED IN THE FUTURE—THAT ATTEMPT TO ASSERT CLASS ACTION CLAIMS, AND BY ACCEPTING THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT YOU ELECT NOT TO PARTICIPATE IN SUCH CASES. IF YOU AGREE TO ARBITRATION WITH THE COMPANY, YOU ARE AGREEING IN ADVANCE THAT YOU WILL NOT PARTICIPATE IN OR SEEK TO RECOVER MONETARY OR OTHER RELIEF IN ANY SUCH CLASS, COLLECTIVE, AND/OR REPRESENTATIVE LAWSUIT. INSTEAD, BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATION, YOU MAY BRING YOUR CLAIMS AGAINST THE COMPANY IN AN INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION PROCEEDING. IF SUCCESSFUL ON SUCH CLAIMS, YOU COULD BE AWARDED MONEY OR OTHER RELIEF BY AN ARBITRATOR.</li>
     <li class="new"><strong>Rules and Forum.</strong> You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, video conference, based on written submissions, or in person in the country where you live or at another mutually agreed location.</li>
     <li class="new"><strong>Arbitrator Powers.</strong> The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and the Company. The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other proceedings or parties. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim or dispute. The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and this Agreement (including this Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator will issue a written statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which any award (or decision not to render an award) is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator shall follow the applicable law. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The arbitrator’s decision is final and binding on you and the Company.</li>
     <li class="new"><strong>Waiver of Jury Trial.</strong> YOU AND THE COMPANY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND RECEIVE A JUDGE OR JURY TRIAL. You and the Company are instead electing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration, except as specified in Section 15(a) above. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.</li>
     <li class="new"><strong>Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions;</strong> Severability. YOU AND THE COMPANY AGREE TO WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO RESOLVE CLAIMS WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE BASIS. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS. CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If, however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable with respect to a particular claim or dispute, neither you nor the Company is entitled to arbitration of such claim or dispute. Instead, all such claims and disputes will then be resolved in a court as set forth in Section 16, and all other provisions of this Section 15 (Dispute Resolution) shall remain in force. If any provision of this Section 15 is adjudged to be void or otherwise unenforceable, in whole or in part, the void or unenforceable provision shall be severed and such adjudication shall not affect the validity of the remainder of this Section 15.</li>
     <li class="new"><strong>Opt Out.</strong> You may opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you do so, neither you nor the Company can force the other to arbitrate as a result of this Agreement. To opt out, you must notify the Company in writing no later than 30 days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, your Halanx username (if any), the email address you used to set up your Halanx account (if you have one), and a CLEAR statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. You must send your opt-out notice to support@halanx.com. If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may have entered into with us or may enter into in the future with us. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN, NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL SUPERSEDE, AMEND, OR MODIFY THE TERMS OF ANY SEPARATE AGREEMENT(S) BETWEEN YOU AND THE COMPANY RELATING TO YOUR WORK AS AN EMPLOYEE OR INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR AGREEMENT GOVERNING YOUR SERVICES AS A SHOPPER.</li>
     <li class="new"><strong>Survival. This Arbitration Agreement will survive any termination of your relationship with the Company.</strong></li>
     <li class="new"><strong>Modification. Notwithstanding any provision in the Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if the Company makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, it will not apply to any individual claim(s) that you had already provided notice of to the Company.</strong></li>
 </ol>
 <div class="head-content">16. General Provisions.</div>
 <p class="new">Nothing in these Terms is to be construed as creating an agency, partnership, or joint venture relationship between Halanx and Merchant, and except as expressly set forth herein, each party shall be responsible for its own costs of performance hereunder.
